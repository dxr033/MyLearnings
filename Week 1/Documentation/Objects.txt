You should avoid calling any of the Object.prototype methods directly from the instance,
especially those that are not intended to be polymorphic (i.e., only its initial behavior
makes sense and no descending object could override it in a meaningful way).
All objects descending from Object.prototype may define a custom own property that has the same name, but with entirely different semantics from what you expect
