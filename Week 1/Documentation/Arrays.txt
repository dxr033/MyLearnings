Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index. We can access individual items using their index,
which is similar to referencing an item in a list based on the itemâ€™s position.
e.g.

const myArray = ['Hello','There','Darcy!']; // index of 3 elements
myArray[2] // contains 'Darcy!'
