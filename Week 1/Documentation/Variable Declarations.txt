let // used in ES6 to declare block-scoped variables
var // used to declare function-scoped variables (can be redeclared and updated)
const // used to declare block-scoped constants (cannot be reassigned) must have a value set cannot be undefined

It is possible to declare multiple variables in a single line using a comma-separated list:
e.g. 
let num = 12, letter = 'a', word = 'abc';
