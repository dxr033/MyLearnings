Learn fetch with calls an API.

The fetch function returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object representing the HTTP response.
You typically use await or .then() to access the response and then call methods like
.json(), .text(), or .blob() 
on the Response object to read the data.

A fetch() promise only rejects when the request fails,
 for example, because of a badly-formed request URL or a network error. 
 A fetch() promise does not reject if the server responds with HTTP status codes that indicate errors
  (404, 504, etc.).
 Instead, a then() handler must check the Response.ok and/or Response.status properties.
