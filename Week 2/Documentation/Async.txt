Async is a Wrapper for Promises

async functions always return a promise. This means we can use traditional promise syntax, like

.then()
 and .catch, with our async functions. An async function will return in one of three ways:

If there’s nothing returned from the function, it will return a promise with a resolved value of undefined.
If there’s a non-promise value returned from the function, it will return a promise resolved to that value.
If a promise is returned from the function, it will simply return that promise

For Example:

async function fivePromise() { 
  return 5;
}

fivePromise()
  .then(resolvedValue => {
    console.log(resolvedValue);
  })  // Prints 5
